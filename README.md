## Manageability

At the moment there is no documented API, ARM or PowerShell code to configure Azure Sentinel

## Why this PowerShell Module

Well at the moment there is simply no PS module or well documented API reference fore creating managing Azure Sentinel. After doing some reverse engineering I was able to find the API's that are currently being used by the Azure Portal and based on that I have written a PowerShell module so that we can manage Azure Sentinel trough PowerShell.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

* Powershell [AZ Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az) - tested with version 2.4.0

### Installing

A step by step Guid how to install module

            "enabled": true,
            "query": "SecurityEvent | where EventID == \"4688\" | where CommandLine contains \"-noni -ep bypass $\"",
            "queryFrequency": "5H",
            "queryPeriod": "5H",
            "triggerOperator": "GreaterThan",
            "triggerThreshold": 5,
            "suppressionDuration": "6H",
            "suppressionEnabled": false,
        }
    ]
}
```
